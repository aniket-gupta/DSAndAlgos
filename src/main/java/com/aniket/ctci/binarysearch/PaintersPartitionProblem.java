     * Painter's Partition ProblemBookmark Suggest Edit

     You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2, A3 â€¦ AN-1}. There are K painters available and you are also given
     how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit of board. You have to get this job done as soon as possible under the
     constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board.

     NOTE:
     1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board
     cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
     2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. Which means a
     configuration where painter 1 paints board 1 and 3 but not 2 is
     invalid.

     Return the ans % 10000003

     Input :
     K : Number of painters
     T : Time taken by painter to paint 1 unit of board
     L : A List which will represent length of each board

     Output:
     return minimum time to paint all boards % 10000003

     Example:

     Input :
     K : 2
     T : 5
     L : [1, 10]

     Output : 50
